A new Flutter project.

## Five Day Weather Forecast

This function of the API actually gives weather forecast for 5 days with data every 3 hours by geographic coordinates. So the List has 40 items. I chose to use the first 3 values of it. The name is a bit misleading now. So we are not showing 5 day forecast but forecast of the next 9 hours.
